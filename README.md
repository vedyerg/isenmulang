# `Isen Mulang`

Isen Mulang is a BUIDL project that tackles the critical problem of data fraud and lack of transparency in real-world supply chains. We use an autonomous AI agent to create a verifiable and immutable digital record of a product's journey on a decentralized network.

Our vision is to build complete trust between producers and consumers by ensuring that every product has a transparent and unchangeable digital story.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```
